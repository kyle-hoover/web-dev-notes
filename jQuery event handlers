event handler has two parts:
	1.	event listener = a method that listens for a specified event to occur, like a click event
	2.	callback function = a function that executes when something triggers the event listener
	
$('.example-class').on('click', () => {
	$('.example-class') = selects all elements of the example-class class
	.on('click') = the event listener (checks if the user has clicked on the example-class element
	second argument to .on() is a callback function (when a 'click' occurs on an example-class element, this function executes)
	 
event listeners:
	'click' = when the user clicks
		$('.example-class').on('click', () => {
	'mouseeneter' = triggers a callback function when a user enters the area that a targeted element occupies
		$('.example-class').on('mouseenter',  () => {
	'mouseleave' = triggers a callback function when a user's mouse leaves the area that an element occupies
		$('.example-class').on('mouseleave', () => {

chaining events = instead of re-declaring the HTML element you're selecting, you can append one event to another
	$('.example-class').on('mouseenter', () => {
		$('.example-class-one').show();
		}).on('mouseleave', () => {
		$('.example-class-one').hide();
});
	you can start the next change after the ending brackets of the previous chain

$('.product-photo').on('mouseenter',() => {
	$('.product-photo').addClass('photo-active');
	}).on('mouseleave', () => {
	$('.product-photo').removeClass('photo-active');
})
	this says that for our product-photo class, when the mouse enters, we will add a css class to zoom in (photo-active)
	when the mouse leaves, we will remove the photo-active class (which will effectively zoom back out)
