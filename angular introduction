AngularJS = a JavaScript web framework aimed to make web apps simple to build and easy to maintain

module = contains the different components of an AngularJS app
	for example <body ng-app="myApp">

directive = defines the application's scope
	tells AngularJS that the myApp module will live within the <body> element, termed the application's scope
	<body ng-app="myApp"> = ng-app is the directive
	
controller = manages the app's data
	ng-controller="MainController" = means that we can use the file MainController to manipulate this information

expressions = display values on the page

<h2> {{promo}} </h2>
	we can use the $scope.promo = "" in javascript to assign a value to this promo item

workflow:
	1.	Create a module, and use ng-app in the view to define the application scope.
	2.	Create a controller, and use ng-controller in the view to define the controller scope.
	3.	Add data to $scope in the controller so they can be displayed with expressions in the view.
			these are going to be the html elements (<h2> {{promo}} </h2>)
			
in javascript:
	$scope.product = {name: 'The Book of Trees', price: 19}
	
in html:
	<p class="title"> {{product.name}} </p> = replaces the paragraph with the name in the .product (in this case "The Book of Trees")
	<p class="price"> {{product.price}} </p> = replaces the paragraph with the price in the .product (in this case 19)
	<p class="price"> {{ product.price | currency }} </p> = changes the price to a currency

filter = {{ output | format }}
	AngularJS gets the value of product.price
	It sends this number into the currency filter. The pipe symbol (|) takes the output on the left and "pipes" it to the right
	The filter outputs a formatted currency with the dollar sign and the correct decimal places
