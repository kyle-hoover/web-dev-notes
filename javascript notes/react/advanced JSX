Grammar in JSX is mostly the same as in HTML, but there are subtle differences to watch out for. 

Class:
	Probably the most frequent of these involves the word class.

	In HTML, it's common to use class as an attribute name:
			
		<h1 class="big">Hey</h1>

	In JSX, you can't use the word class! You have to use className instead:
		
		<h1 className="big">Hey</h1>
	
	This is because JSX gets translated into JavaScript, and class is a reserved word in JavaScript.

	When JSX is rendered, JSX className attributes are automatically rendered as class attributes.

	const myDiv = <div className="big">I AM A BIG DIV</div> = when this renders, it will render the css with the class "big"
	
Self-closing tags:
	Most HTML elements use two tags: an opening tag (<div>), and a closing tag (</div>). 
	
	However, some HTML elements such as <img> and <input> use only one tag. 
	
	The tag that belongs to a single-tag element isn't an opening tag nor a closing tag; it's a self-closing tag.

	When you write a self-closing tag in HTML, it is optional to include a forward-slash immediately before the final angle-bracket:

		Fine in HTML with a slash:

  			<br />

		Also fine, without the slash:

  			<br>
	But!

	In JSX, you have to include the slash. If you write a self-closing tag in JSX and forget the slash, you will raise an error:

		Fine in JSX:

			<br />

		NOT FINE AT ALL in JSX:

			<br>
