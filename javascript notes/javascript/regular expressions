Regular expressions are special strings that represent a search pattern. 

Also known as "regex" or "regexp", they help programmers match, search, and replace text. 

Regular expressions can appear cryptic because a few characters have special meaning. 

The goal is to combine the symbols and text into a pattern that matches what you want, but only what you want. 

Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match parts of strings. 

You create patterns to help you do that matching.

If you want to find the word "the" in the string "The dog chased the cat", you could use the following regular expression: /the/. 

Notice that quote marks are not required within the regular expression.

Test Method:
	JavaScript has multiple ways to use regexes. 
	
	One way to test a regex is using the .test() method. 
	
		The .test() method takes the regex, applies it to a string (which is placed inside the parentheses), and returns true or false if your pattern finds something or not.
		
		let testStr = "freeCodeCamp";
		let testRegex = /Code/;
		var result = testRegex.test(testStr);
		// Returns true
