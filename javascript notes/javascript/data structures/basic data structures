One Dimensional Array:
	The below is an example of the simplest implementation of an array data structure. 
			
		let simpleArray = ['one', 2, 'three’, true, false, undefined, null];
		console.log(simpleArray.length);
		// logs 7
		
	This is known as a one-dimensional array, meaning it only has one level, or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it. 

	Notice it contains booleans, strings, and numbers, among other valid JavaScript data types:
	
	All array's have a length property, which as shown above, can be very easily accessed with the syntax Array.length.

Multi-dimensional Array:
	A more complex implementation of an array can be seen below. 
		let complexArray = [
		[
			{
				one: 1,
				two: 2
			},
			{
				three: 3,
				four: 4
			}
		],
		[
			{
				a: "a",
				b: "b"
			},
			{
				c: "c",
				d: “d”
			}
		]
	];
	
	This is known as a multi-dimensional array, or an array that contains other arrays. 
	
	Notice that this array also contains JavaScript objects 
	
	Arrays are also capable of storing complex objects.
