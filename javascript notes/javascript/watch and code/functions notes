think of functions as recipes

makeTurkeySandwich() {
  put bread on bottom
  put turkey on bread
  put bread on top
}

makeSandwichWith _____
  put bread on bottom;
  put _____ on bread;
  but bread on top;
  
makeSandwichWith(filling) {
  put bread on bottom;
  put filling on bread;
  put bread on top;
}

Example function:
  function sayHiTo(person) {
    console.log("hi", person)
  }
  
  function sayHiTo("Kyle")  //prints "hi Kyle" (person = "Kyle" now)
    
we can run a function by just calling it 
  makeSandwichWith()
