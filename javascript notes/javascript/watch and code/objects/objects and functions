Basic Example:
	var k = {
		name: "Kyle"
		sayName:	function () {		//don't need to put the sayName function () because we're accessing through the property sayName
			console.log(this);		//javascript uses the keyword "this" to refer to the entire object a function would be in
		}
		
	kyle.sayName(); //outputs {name: "Kyle"}
	
	//we don't use console.log(name) because name would be a variable and the name property is considered an object property not a variable!
	
If we want sayName to say "Kyle" rather than provide the whole object:
		var k = {
		name: "Kyle"
		sayName:	function () {		
			console.log(this.name);			
		}
