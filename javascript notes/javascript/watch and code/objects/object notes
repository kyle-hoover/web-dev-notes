What is an object?
	Used to group related data and functions together
  
	Example of my Mac:
		operatingSystem	mac
		screenSize	13 inch
		purchaseYear	2016
		
Getting this into JavaScript
	var myComputer = {
		operatingSystem:	"mac",			//Properties = operatingSystem, screenSize, purchaseYear
		screenSize:	"13 inch",			//Values = "mac", "13 inch", 2016
		purchaseYear:	2016,				//"mac" and "13 inch" are strings whereas we can keep 2016 as a number
	}

Can call the object by just typing the name of it:
	myComputer
	//prints {operatingSystem: "mac", screenSize: "13 inch", purchaseYear: 2016}

Getting a specific part of the object:
	Use a period to target a specific part of the object
	
	Example:
		myComputer.operatingSystem
		//prints "mac"
