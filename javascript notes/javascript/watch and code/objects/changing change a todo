we need to update the change function so it can target the new todoText property from the add a todo
	
	addTodo: function(todoText) {
  	this.todos.push({
    	todoText: todoText,				//our goal is to be able to target the first todoText here
    	completed: false
  	});
  	this.displayTodos();
  },
	
when we run our addTodo function, a new todo OBJECT is added to the blank ARRAY we initially made

we need to be able to access this new object that was created in order to change it

specifically, we want to target the second todoText (after the colon), because that was the text that was pushed to that object
	
our new change function:

	changeTodo: function(position, todoText) {
		this.todos[position].todoText = todoText;		//this accesses the object, .todos accesses our todos, [position] finds the position that's being targetted in our array of todos, .todoText is the property that we're changing
		this.displayTodos();
	}
