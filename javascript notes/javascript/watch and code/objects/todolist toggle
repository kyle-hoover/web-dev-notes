toggle completed = boolean

! = bang operator (shows the opposite)

First part of our toggle function:
	toggleCompleted: function(position) {							//needs a position so we know which todo we're toggling
	
Next part:
	var todo = this.todos[position];						//a reference to our todos (we use position to grab a specific todo)
