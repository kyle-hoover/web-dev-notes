Instead of adjusting your overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, you can add a background-color to the element holding the text you want to emphasize. 
This challenge uses rgba() instead of hex codes or normal rgb().

rgba stands for:
r = red
g = green
b = blue
a = alpha/level of opacity

The RGB values can range from 0 to 255. 
	The alpha value can range from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear. 
	rgba() is great to use in this case, as it allows you to adjust the opacity. 
	This means you don't have to completely block out the background.

You'll use background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1) for this challenge. 
	It produces a dark gray color that is nearly transparent given the low opacity value of 0.1.

The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.
	The box-shadow property takes values for offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element), offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element), blur-radius, spread-radius and a color value, in that order. 
		The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:
	box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
	this adds a shadow behind whatever element it's applied to
	
The opacity property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.
	A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
	A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
	A value of 0 is completely transparent.

The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.
