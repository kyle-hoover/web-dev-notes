The text-transform property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. 
	It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.
	Example: text-transform: uppercase

The following table shows how the different text-transformvalues change the example text "Transform me".

Value		Result
lowercase	"transform me"
uppercase	"TRANSFORM ME"
capitalize	"Transform Me"
initial		Use the default value
inherit		Use the text-transform value from the parent element
none		Default: Use the original text

The font-size property is used to specify how large the text is in a given element. 
	This rule can be used for multiple elements to create visual consistency of text on a page. 
	Example: font-size: 62px;

The font-weight property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.
	Example: font-weight: 800;
	
CSS offers the line-height property to change the height of each line in a block of text. 
	As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.
	Example: line-height: 25px;
