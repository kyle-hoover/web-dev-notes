Imagine you are building an App and have created three components, a Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children. 
To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. 
For example, in the render method you could write:

  return (
  <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
  </App>
  )
  
When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. 
This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.
