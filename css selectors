linking css in html = <link href="./style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"> (assuming the css is in the same directory as HTML)

p { = selects all paragraph elements

.brand { = selects classes (in this case all classes with the name brand)

can also include two different classes in html:
	.green {
		color: green;
	}
	.bold {
		font-weight: bold;
	}
	
	<h1 class="green bold"> ... </h1>
	
#large-title { = selects IDs (in this case all IDs with the name large-title)

css places priority on specificity (least important being tag then class then ID being most important)

h1.special { = would select only the h1 elements that have a class of special 
	if a p element also had a class of special, the rule in the example would not style the paragraph
	
<ul class='main-list'>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul>
	The nested <li> elements are selected with the following CSS:
		.main-list li {
		
p {
  color: blue;
}


.main p {
  color: red;
}
	Both of these CSS rules define what a p element should look like
	Since .main p has a class and a p tag as its selector, only the p elements inside the .main element will appear red
	This occurs despite there being another more general rule that states p elements should be blue
