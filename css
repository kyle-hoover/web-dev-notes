Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property.

text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.

text-align: center; centers the text

text-align: right; right-aligns the text

And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS. 
Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units (such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. 

Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:
  img {
    width: 220px;
  }

You can specify the height of an element using the height property in CSS, similar to the width property. 

Here's an example that changes the height of an image to 20px:
  img {
    height: 20px;
  }

To make text bold, you can use the strong tag.
  With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of font-weight: bold; to the element.

To underline text, you can use the u tag. 
  With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: underline; to the element.
