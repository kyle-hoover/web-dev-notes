.css() = jQuery to modify CSS properties of an element

$('.example-class').css('color', '#FFFFFF');
	.example-class = the class we're changing
	.css = the first argument is the CSS property we want to change (in this case, that's 'color')
	#FFFFFF = new value for the given property in the first argument (the .css() method changes the color of .example-class elements to '#FFFFFF')
