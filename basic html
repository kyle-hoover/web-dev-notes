<!DOCTYPE> = specifies the version of HTML. <!DOCTYPE html> is the first line of any HTML document and tells the browser what version of HTML we're using

<html> = root of the entire document
  
<head> = section that provides the page title, meta info, includes other files, etc.
  
<body> = the actual content
  
<p> = appears anywhere within the body to represent a paragraph of text expressing a single thought.
	Usually displayed with vertical space before and after the paragraph

<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>...</head>
<body>
	(all web content goes here!)
	<p> This is a paragraph within the p tag that expresses a single thought or idea. The paragraph should be surrounded with a vertical white space buffer both before and after the paragraph. </p>
</body>
</html>

HTML specifies the structure but not how the content will be displayed. It is up to the browser to decide how to display the content.

HTML supports 6 section heading tags
	<h1> used for most important titles (ex. title of entire web page)
	<h2-h5> used for next important subheader
	<h6> used for least important subheader
	Magnitude of importance affects font size that will be displayed
	Can be used to divide content into readable subsections
	Browser determines font and size depending on header magnitude
	
<body>
	<h1>This is the most important header</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph supporting the most important header.</p>
	<h3>This is a subheader</h3>
	<p>This is a paragraph supporting the subheader. Notice that the font size of the subheader is smaller than the size of the most important header.</p>
</body>

<b> = indicates that the text should be bold
<i> = indicates that the text should be italicized
	
<strong> = indicates that the text should be bold and is more important
<em> = indicates that the text should be italicized and emphasized
	
<hr> = represents a more serious shift in content, visually separates content by inserting a visible line between preceding and subsequent content (creates a horizontal line)
<br> = represents a single line break, inserts a blank line

<div>
	Provides additional structure (this part of the content goes together)
	Block-level container for organized content
	Often used for:
		Page headers/footers
		Menu or nav bar
		Photo galleries
		Ads or outside media

<span> = here's some text/content that we were going to eventually apply some formatting/styling to
	Inline container for organized content
	Usually a smaller part of content than the div tag
	Block-level elements (div) are designed to contain larger chunks of content designed to stand alone as a unit
	Inline elements (span) are designed to contain smaller
